Hi, I'm Aliyu Ibrahim. I'm the founder and editor-in-chief of this YouTube channel. I've been passionate about tech since I was a kid, and I love sharing my knowledge and insights with others.
<br>
I started this channel in 2022 because I wanted to create a medium for people who wanted to stay up-to-date on the latest tech news and trends. I believe that everyone should have access to accurate and unbiased information about tech, so that they can make informed decisions about their purchases and use of technology.
<br>
I plan to grow my channel into one of the leading tech channels in the world. 
<br>
We want our viewer to feel like they are part of a community, and we want them to be able to trust us as a source of reliable information.
